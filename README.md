# Code_grep

while exploring for some ideas, we saw Github. We realised it would be a nice idea to work with the codes like github but also have additional features which Github lacked.
We decided to make a databases for programmers to provide them with the details of the code, provide a platform for them to share it and to ask their queries. The interesting part would be to
create a database of functions, classes, interfaces, Packages and Libraries. 
Here is what we planned :
1) User can create a repository. They can add description and tags to this repository. For eg. Sorting-algorithms .
2) We chose the syntax of Java as our base for parsing the code.
3) When the user creates a library or a package, he/she can add description to it along with tags.
4) When the user writes code of a class in a file, they are required to add comments in a4 specific style, similar to javadoc .
5) The information can be extracted by parsing the code. User can add tags and description about classes. 
6) For a function, he/she can explain return type and parameters .
7) All this information will be stored in database. Now, if somebody searches sorting . We will display relevant classes/functions/packages/library etc.

We also identified the following additional features :
1) A Bug tracker system where somebody can submit their bugs and ask for help. Others can follow a bug and if it feels good, follow it.
2) A Q&A system where you can ask questions and find answers to them. User can also put price on his/her code and sell it.
3) A user will have reputations which dictate behavior on the system.

We also identified the following stakeholders :
Programmers : They can ask questions, share codes, solve bugs, ask for bugs, get their codes documented etc. As they are the main users, they will act as moderators,editors in the forum.
Communities : Open source communities, educators etc., can share their codes in a much better way. They can also get contributions. They can share their knowledge through a Q&A portal.
Companies: Companies can buy and sell codes. We have options for keeping a repository public or private . Companies can document their codes there.
Recruiters: Recruiters can see how many bugs a user has solved, his reputation, his answers and his repositories and then can directly contact them,if they want.
